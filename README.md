# Biodiversity-Starter-Project

Hello all! Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio Project on Biodioversity. 
This project explores the conservation statuses of endangered species in different parks and investigates any patterns or themes related to the types of species that become endangered.
The data used for analysis is sourced from the National Parks Service. 

At the end of the project, the following questions will be answered:
1. What is the distribution of conservation status for animals?
2. Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
3. Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
4. Which species were spotted the most at each park?
