# Biodiversity-Starter-Project

Hello all! Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio Project on Biodioversity. 
This project explores the conservation statuses of endangered species in different parks and investigates any patterns or themes related to the types of species that become endangered.
The data used for analysis is sourced from the National Parks Service.
